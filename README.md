This is a project for a class, we built an Android App that facilitates Walkin-Clinic appointments and allows Users to search for clinics. Also allows for Walkin Clinic owners to list their services offered, and other information about the Clinic.

This is connected with a Firebase Real-time Database, I worked primarily back-end with a touch of front-end.
