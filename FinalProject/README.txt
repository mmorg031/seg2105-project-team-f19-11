Presented here is our Deliverable 1, some comments can be made. This deliverable provides 
functionality to allow users to create accounts; whether it be patient or employee.
An admin account has been hardcoded into the data base already 
(see the Firebase_database_adminUser.pdf), currently there is no action put in place as this 
deliverable did not specify. In the future we can code logic to allow this user to have
desired functionality.

Additionally, the passwords are stored within the Firebase Authentication as hash-values, I believe
this should suffice for now!
